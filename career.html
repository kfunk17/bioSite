                   <p>  Bob worked for <a href="https://www.bnsf.com/" target="_blank">Burlington Northern Santa Fe</a> for thirty years until
                     he retired in 2005. 
                        He first started working as a crew member up in Alliance, Nebraska. In the 1980's he took a job as a signal electronic
                         technician in McCook, Nebraska. He was on call 24/7 rain or shine. He covered the stretch of tracks from Wray, Colorado 
                         to Hastings, Nebraska and made sure the signals were working properly. He was good at his job and never complained about
                         getting called out at 3 AM on occasions when the railroad would need him.
