                   <p>        Bob Funk is an awesome dad, husband, brother, friend, 
                              nice guy, and a hard worker. He grew up in Sutherland, 
                              Nebraska and was the youngest of six boys. When he was 
                              a teen he was sent to take care of his grandmother in Wallace,
                              Nebraska. In his early twenties he moved to North Platte, 
                              Nebraska and worked for North Platte Hydroelectric Plant. 
                              Not long after that he went to work for Nebraska Public Power.
                              Bob’s dad and two other brothers went to work for the railroad 
                              and he decided he would do the same. So in his mid to late 
                              twenties he moved to Hyannis, Nebraska and worked for
                              Burlington Northern Santa Fe. He worked for the crews for a
                              while and then in the mid 1980’s he decided to apply for a 
                              signal electronic technician job in McCook, Nebraska. 
                              He was hired for the job and retired after thirty years of 
                              hard work.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                              He currently lives just outside of McCook, Ne and works part 
                              time for O’Reilly Auto Parts. While he might be slowing down 
                              physically these days, mentally he is still sharp as a tack. 
                              I once asked his brother Charles what he thought of him, 
                              his response was short, but it was absolutely brilliant, 
                              “Bob has more knowledge in his pinky than most people do in 
                              their entire bodies.”
