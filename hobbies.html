                   <p>  He has a few hobbies that occupy his time. 
                        One of them is ham radio. He has been into amateur radio for
                        a long time now and his call sign is KA0PKC. He has a room 
                        full of radio’s that he knows all about. His other hobby 
                        is cars. His pride and joy is a 1967 Ford Mustang Fastback 
                        with a 390 engine that he built and installed himself. He 
                        bought the car in 1966 and has owned it since. He spends 
                        his summers taking the car to car shows around Nebraska and 
                        Kansas. Not only does he own that car, but he also owns a 
                        1981 Corvette, a 1994 Jaguar, a 1986 and a 1978 Monte Carlo.
                         He also spends his summers drag racing his ‘78 Monte Carlo. 
                         The man is 74 years old and still gets out there and drag races.
